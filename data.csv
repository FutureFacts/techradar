Semantic Versioning,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Correctly versioning software that makes sense to everyone using it isn't easy. Using a mature versioning scheme like <a href=""https://semver.org/"">Semantic Versioning</a> helps you version your software service APIs in a way that allows consumers of your service to easily understand the severity of the changes in the new version. It is important to remember that a corresponding git tag of the version should be applied to the commit in the VCS that the versioned artifact was built from."
Pipelines as Code,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Pipelines as code is defining the build and deployment pipeline declaratively through code instead of configuring it in a specific CI/CD tooling.
Process mining,trial,techniques,TRUE,Process mining is a family of techniques relating the fields of data science and process management to support the analysis of operational processes based on event logs. The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions. Process mining is an integral part of data science, fueled by the availability of data and the desire to improve processes.Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify and address performance and compliance problems.
Pair Programming,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"">Pair Programming</a> is an Agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at some kind of shared workstation setup. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. We believe that although this may seem as an inefficient usage of our developers' time, the quality of the code produced leads to less time consuming problems later. Other benefits include improved knowledge and skills sharing and team communication."
Internal Open Source Products,trial,techniques,TRUE,"To help maintain and govern internal libraries that are shared across teams, the libraries can be treated as products that follow the open source model for governance and contribution."
Docker,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,"Development teams love Docker, as the Docker image format makes it easier to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a packaging mechanism for self-contained services."
Kubernetes,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,"Kubernetes is Google's answer to the problem of deploying containers into a cluster of machines, which is becoming an increasingly common scenario."
Cassandra,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,"Apache's Cassandra database is a powerful, scalable Big Data solution for storing and processing large amounts of data, often using hundreds of nodes split over multiple worldwide locations. Use Cassandra carefully. Teams often misunderstand the use case for Cassandra, attempting to use it as a general-purpose data store when in fact it is optimized for fast reads on large data sets based on predefined keys or indexes. Its dependence on the storage schema can also make it difficult to evolve over time. Cassandra also has significant operational complexity and some rough edges, so unless you absolutely need the scaling it provides, a simpler solution is usually better."
Databricks,trial,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,An open and unified data analytics platform for data engineering, data science, machine learning, and analytics. From the original creators of Apache SparkTM, Delta lake, MLflow, and Koalas.
Kafka,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,"Apache Kafka continues to build momentum as an open source messaging framework that provides a solution for publishing ordered event feeds to large numbers of independent, lightweight consumers. Configuring Kafka can be difficult."
Windows Containers,assess,platforms & frameworks,FALSE,"To achieve legacy in a box for many of our CSP applications that target the .Net Framework, Windows Containers should be explored as a possible solution."
Oracle,hold,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,Proprietary software is discouraged by the Open Source Software culture.
MySQL,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,"MySQL is a fast, reliable and stable open source database management system. It has most of the features which oracle provides.  It is a relational database and is suitable where persisting data in a relational way is beneficial. It is being used by PD/PMP."
Python 3,adopt,languages,TRUE,"Python 3 introduced many useful features that are not backward compatible with Python 2.x. It also removed numerous Python 2.x features that were maintained for backward compatibility, making Python 3 easier to learn and use and more consistent with the rest of the language. If you are developing in Python we strongly encourage you to use Python 3."
TypeScript, trial, languages,TRUE,"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code."

CodeCommit,adopt,tools,TRUE,AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. You can use CodeCommit to securely store anything from source code to binaries, and it works seamlessly with your existing Git tools.
GitLab,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline[8] features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.
PySpark,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,PySpark is the collaboration of Apache Spark and Python. Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework, built around speed, ease of use, and streaming analytics whereas Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It provides a wide range of libraries and is majorly used for Machine Learning and Real-Time Streaming Analytics. In other words, it is a Python API for Spark that lets you harness the simplicity of Python and the power of Apache Spark in order to tame Big Data. 
FastAPI,trial,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
Flask,adopt,platforms & frameworks,TRUE,Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[2] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.
